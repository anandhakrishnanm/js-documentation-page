                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:
                    </p>

                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                             HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and page navigation.

                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                             provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                        in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                        Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                        JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                        loosely typed methods.

                    <p class="para">
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                         be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                         you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                        function return types are not explicitly typed.

                        JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                        identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                        _name.
